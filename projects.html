      <h2>Hangman Game</h2> 
      <p>This is a game that I created in Grade 12, using Java, and 
      in particular, the NetBeans IDE. This project includes an
      application for the game, a user guide, a feasability study, a Gantt chart
      a user guide, and more. To see this project, check out my GitHub page! </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Shell Project</h2> 
      <p>This is a program that I created in the CSC209 course, at UTM. It is 
        essentially the Shell/Command Prompt of the Linux operating system. It 
        consists of all of the main commands, such as ls, cwd, cd, as well as 
        pipes, sockets, signals, etc. To see this project, check out my GitHub page! </p>

      <h2>Image Compressor/Decompressor</h2> 
      <p>This is a program that I created in the CSC148 course, at UTM. It is 
           a program that uses the quadtree ADT to compress and decompress images.

        <h2>Meepo is You</h2> 
        <p>This is a program that I created in the CSC148 course, at UTM. It is 
          a program that is very similar to the game "Babba is you". You control a 
          character named Meepo, and have to create rules for the game that 
          allow you to win. To see this project, check out my GitHub page! </p>
