      <p>Hello, my name is Ishav Sohal, and welcome to my website! I hope you are having a great day!
        This is a project 
        that I decided to take on in order to gain more experience with web development, 
        and to have a place to put my portfolio and other infomration about myself. Below, I have 
        included my contact information as well as the coding projects that I have worked on.<p></p> 
        <br>
      <p>I am currently a third year student at the University of Toronto Missisauge, purusing
      the Computer Science speacialist program, and the Mathematical Sciences minor program. 
      In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends/family, spending time in nature
      and going to the gym!</p>
